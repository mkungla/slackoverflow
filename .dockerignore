# source:  https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file
# Before the docker CLI sends the context to the docker daemon, it looks for a file named
# .dockerignore in the root directory of the context. If this file exists, the CLI modifies
# the context to exclude files and directories that match patterns in it. This helps to
# avoid unnecessarily sending large or sensitive files and directories to the daemon and
# potentially adding them to images using ADD or COPY.
#
# The CLI interprets the .dockerignore file as a newline-separated list of patterns similar
# to the file globs of Unix shells. For the purposes of matching, the root of the context
# is considered to be both the working and the root directory. For example, the patterns
# /foo/bar and foo/bar both exclude a file or directory named bar in the foo subdirectory
# of PATH or in the root of the git repository located at URL. Neither excludes anything else.
#
# If a line in .dockerignore file starts with # in column 1, then this line is considered as
# a comment and is ignored before interpreted by the CLI.
# Here is an example .dockerignore file:
#
# # comment - Ignored
# */temp*   - Exclude files and directories whose names start with temp in any immediate
#   subdirectory of the root. For example, the plain file /somedir/temporary.txt is excluded,
#   as is the directory /somedir/temp.
# */*/temp* - Exclude files and directories starting with temp from any subdirectory that is
#   two levels below the root. For example, /somedir/subdir/temporary.txt is excluded.
# temp?     - Exclude files and directories in the root directory whose names are a one-character
#   extension of temp. For example, /tempa and /tempb are excluded.
